## Model Zoo

The results are the 3D detection performance of moderate difficulty on the *val* set of KITTI dataset.

Note that the performance may vary a little due to sampling in PointNet++ encoder.

## Installation

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for the installation of `OpenPCDet`.

To train `PG-RCNN`, You need to additionally install [`pytorch3d`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d) for utilizing Chamfer Distance. 
We recommend using pytorch3d ver0.7.0.

## Getting Started

Please refer to [GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) to learn more usage about this project.

### Important: Generate approximated complete object points
Under `pcdet` directory, execute:
```python 
python -m pcdet.datasets.multifindbestfit
```


## License

`PG-RCNN` is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).
